Babcock sketched out a framework that has the entire sustainment effort, from planning through long-term execution being provided solely by VSE Arabia as a sub to LM; and has the non-building part of new construction (ILS, Fleet Introduction, Training, etc.) also provided by VSE Arabia.  In addition, LM discussed that they plan on comitting to build an aluminum welding training facility for Zamil w/ the potential for VSE Arabia doing everything from building the facility to training the students.  In the combat systems area, LM suggested that perhaps VSE Arabia could hire US combat systems techs/engineers that must work in Saudi as part of the program.  Despite the ships being built in the US, Saudis want the the maximum possible work to be done in-country.  Babcock also stressed that we werent limited to work in Saudi & could perform In-CONUS work wherever we could provide value. ... ... ... ... ... ... This framework was received better than expected.  All agreed that the final answer would be a blend of LM, VSE Arabia, and potentially other Saudi companies but the use of VSE Arabia is compelling and LM ended up suggesting more areas where cooperation might be possible. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... LMs Offset guy has already informally broached the use of VSE Arabia w/ the Saudi Offset Committee & received positive response.  Next step in Offset area is a LM white paper to the Offset Committee explaining in more detail how VSE Arabia would fit into the overall plan -- Babcock owes a VSE Arabia company profile for inclusion in this paper. ... ... ... ... ... Way ahead: next week LMs LCS Sustainment guys will build a Saudi MMCS Sustainment program outline based on USN process; Babcock will help and, in the process, secure specific areas of work for VSE Arabia.  Resulting product will form the basis of LMs July pitch to RSNF. ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

The primary takeaways from the meeting:    The funding line for removal, repair and reinstallation of the Marine Gas Turbine Gas Generator is $1.9M.  This will be used to fund labor, material and travel for Wood Group Pratt & Whitney (WGPW) to provide one service representative for the removal of the GG4A gas generator, shipment of the gas generator to the WGPW repair facility, Open and Inspect, follow-on repairs, engine testing, re-shipment of the engine to Alameda, CA and re-installation. The repair time line is estimated to be from 90-120 days (dependent on results of the Open and Inspect).    The funding line for the repair of one of the Main Propulsion Diesel Engines (MPDE) has been reduced from $1.3M to $360K.  The USCG has withheld funding for Center Section Overhaul (CSO) kit which is about $600K.  There will be sufficient funding to cover the labor/travel quote from Fairbanks Morse Engine for one service representative and the cost for one VSE subject matter expert (Guy Chrzas) during the 42-day overhaul period, however there will be scarce funding to cover growth work or to fund outside machinists/riggers (if not provided by Bangladesh Navy) to assist in the overhaul.    The funding line for the Supply Support has been reduced from $2M to $1.1M.  This will allow procurement of most of the parts that were priced by VSE in October 2014.  Paul has requested that the parts should be shipped to USCG Logistics Center in Alameda to inventory/warehouse since they reduced the funding rather than being consolidated in VSE-Chesapeake.  This plan could change if USCG pushes back.    The funding line for Emergent Technical Support labor has been reduced to $115K from $300K.  This amount may be needed to fund outside machinists/riggers if they are not available from the Bangladesh Navy.    The total amount of the new DO is estimated to be $3.567M which was reduced from the original amount of $5.1M.  There is a follow-on meeting on 15 April at NAVSEA scheduled with PMS326, VSE and USCG to discuss the time line of the engine repairs and the procurement of the parts lists.

Paul was thinking if he could have Thomas Gearhart that would be sufficient support from VSE.  His transfer manager will be Joe Garcia (great guy but not a clue on ship transfers).  I reminded Paul that he had called me right before Christmas and had ask me who was going to manage the ship transfers and I had told him I would.  He acknowledged that conversation but said he had forgotten.  I also reminded him that he wanted to get together and discuss, which had not happened with his travel and vacation time since Christmas.  However, we had provided Steve Keith information on shipyard costs – West vice East Coast) and we briefed him on our plan for keeping the FFGs warm after decommissioning.  We also briefed him on the process we use in developing a Preliminary SARP with ROM pricing, Preliminary Work Definition Conference, ordering long lead material, writing specifications, selecting a ship yard, conducting a Work Definition Conference finishing buying material and starting the shipyard overhaul.  Based on Paul’s comment none of this information had made it to Paul.    Paul was talking about doing one ship on the West Coast and one on the East coast because of the cost of towing the ship from the West Coast to the East Coast.  I mentioned to him that the labor difference between the West and East was about $20 an hour so then he said well maybe it would be better to do both ships on the East Coast.  He was also saying he thought doing the shipyard overhauls in Jacksonville made a lot of sense.  His reasoning is they have a berthing barge that can be towed across the river from Mayport, that Southeast Regional Maintenance Center, (SERMC) would be a big advantage since they have expertise.  He was also thinking SERMC could do some work if the shipyard was behind schedule and the Port Engineers for the FFGs is home based out of Mayport.  I provided him advertised pricing between Detyens and BAE Jax, with Detyens being about $15.50 per hour cheaper.  Told him that does not mean that these are the prices the shipyard will bid anticipate they will both come down depending on their work load.  Paul is aware that Taiwan is very interested in going back to Detyens but he has told them that the messing and berthing that was available during the Kidds is not available.  He is pushing Taiwan to go for open competition and I told him on the East Coast we expected BAE Jax, Detyens and Colonnas to be the bidders if we put the package out to bid.   We also talked a little about keeping ships warm after being decommissioned but he didn’t think there was a lot of support for this.  He did say they were looking at ways to keep from towing the San Diego ship to Hawaii to INACTSHIPS.  I told him based on having some Taiwan personnel available and some of our key personnel that for about $1M (USN providing pier and services) we could keep the ship warm for about 3 months.    He indicate that Taiwan is considering sending a detachment of personnel to the US to be home based out of TECRO Washington to go visit the inactive ships once a month to make sure equipment and material was not being removed.  Paul hopes this happens because this is confirmation that Taiwan will take the ships.   I told Paul I would be happy to have Thomas work with us but that I was looking a Bill Reynolds to help me with a lot of the planning.  He said he did not know Bill.  (Pete Desrosiers a couple of days later called Paul to get a read from him and he is OK with me doing the Transfer and using Bill and he said yes and remembers his phone call to me in late December.  He would like for Thomas to be part of the team.)   Since our meeting we have provided Paul with ROM towing costs up and down the East Coast and from West Coast to East Coast.  We also provided him with shipyard hourly costs and approximate total cost for shipyard labor based on the Pakistan overhaul of McInerney for BAE San Diego, Norfolk, Jax and Detyens.  Approximate difference between San Diego and Detyens is over $4.5M.

In the combat systems area, LM suggested that perhaps VSE Arabia could hire US combat systems techs/engineers that must work in Saudi as part of the program.

The primary takeaways from the meeting:    The funding line for removal, repair and reinstallation of the Marine Gas Turbine Gas Generator is $1.9M.  This will be used to fund labor, material and travel for Wood Group Pratt & Whitney (WGPW) to provide one service representative for the removal of the GG4A gas generator, shipment of the gas generator to the WGPW repair facility, Open and Inspect, follow-on repairs, engine testing, re-shipment of the engine to Alameda, CA and re-installation. The repair time line is estimated to be from 90-120 days (dependent on results of the Open and Inspect).    The funding line for the repair of one of the Main Propulsion Diesel Engines (MPDE) has been reduced from $1.3M to $360K.  The USCG has withheld funding for Center Section Overhaul (CSO) kit which is about $600K.  There will be sufficient funding to cover the labor/travel quote from Fairbanks Morse Engine for one service representative and the cost for one VSE subject matter expert (Guy Chrzas) during the 42-day overhaul period, however there will be scarce funding to cover growth work or to fund outside machinists/riggers (if not provided by Bangladesh Navy) to assist in the overhaul.    The funding line for the Supply Support has been reduced from $2M to $1.1M.  This will allow procurement of most of the parts that were priced by VSE in October 2014.  Paul has requested that the parts should be shipped to USCG Logistics Center in Alameda to inventory/warehouse since they reduced the funding rather than being consolidated in VSE-Chesapeake.  This plan could change if USCG pushes back.    The funding line for Emergent Technical Support labor has been reduced to $115K from $300K.  This amount may be needed to fund outside machinists/riggers if they are not available from the Bangladesh Navy.

Paul was thinking if he could have Thomas Gearhart that would be sufficient support from VSE.  His transfer manager will be Joe Garcia (great guy but not a clue on ship transfers).  I reminded Paul that he had called me right before Christmas and had ask me who was going to manage the ship transfers and I had told him I would.  He acknowledged that conversation but said he had forgotten.  I also reminded him that he wanted to get together and discuss, which had not happened with his travel and vacation time since Christmas.  However, we had provided Steve Keith information on shipyard costs – West vice East Coast) and we briefed him on our plan for keeping the FFGs warm after decommissioning.  We also briefed him on the process we use in developing a Preliminary SARP with ROM pricing, Preliminary Work Definition Conference, ordering long lead material, writing specifications, selecting a ship yard, conducting a Work Definition Conference finishing buying material and starting the shipyard overhaul.  Based on Paul’s comment none of this information had made it to Paul.    Paul was talking about doing one ship on the West Coast and one on the East coast because of the cost of towing the ship from the West Coast to the East Coast.  I mentioned to him that the labor difference between the West and East was about $20 an hour so then he said well maybe it would be better to do both ships on the East Coast.  He was also saying he thought doing the shipyard overhauls in Jacksonville made a lot of sense.  His reasoning is they have a berthing barge that can be towed across the river from Mayport, that Southeast Regional Maintenance Center, (SERMC) would be a big advantage since they have expertise.  He was also thinking SERMC could do some work if the shipyard was behind schedule and the Port Engineers for the FFGs is home based out of Mayport.  I provided him advertised pricing between Detyens and BAE Jax, with Detyens being about $15.50 per hour cheaper.  Told him that does not mean that these are the prices the shipyard will bid anticipate they will both come down depending on their work load.  Paul is aware that Taiwan is very interested in going back to Detyens but he has told them that the messing and berthing that was available during the Kidds is not available.  He is pushing Taiwan to go for open competition and I told him on the East Coast we expected BAE Jax, Detyens and Colonnas to be the bidders if we put the package out to bid.   We also talked a little about keeping ships warm after being decommissioned but he didn’t think there was a lot of support for this.  He did say they were looking at ways to keep from towing the San Diego ship to Hawaii to INACTSHIPS.  I told him based on having some Taiwan personnel available and some of our key personnel that for about $1M (USN providing pier and services) we could keep the ship warm for about 3 months.    He indicate that Taiwan is considering sending a detachment of personnel to the US to be home based out of TECRO Washington to go visit the inactive ships once a month to make sure equipment and material was not being removed.  Paul hopes this happens because this is confirmation that Taiwan will take the ships.   I told Paul I would be happy to have Thomas work with us but that I was looking a Bill Reynolds to help me with a lot of the planning.  He said he did not know Bill.  (Pete Desrosiers a couple of days later called Paul to get a read from him and he is OK with me doing the Transfer and using Bill and he said yes and remembers his phone call to me in late December.  He would like for Thomas to be part of the team.)   Since our meeting we have provided Paul with ROM towing costs up and down the East Coast and from West Coast to East Coast.  We also provided him with shipyard hourly costs and approximate total cost for shipyard labor based on the Pakistan overhaul of McInerney for BAE San Diego, Norfolk, Jax and Detyens.
