As the day went on discussion was also held how to support the transfer of the 110 foot cutters if the USCG shipyard at Curtis Bay was booked.  There was also discussion of using VSE to complete contracting quicker than using USCG contracting and utilizing us to complete overhaul of engines, etc. since we can execute much faster than the USCG contracting.   There was emphases on the 110 footers since there is a possibility of transferring ships to two countries with overlapping dates.  The USCG Cutter Transfer Division (CTD) is only set up for one country at a time and doing underway training they have limited manpower.

After the tour the CTD and 326 personnel met with all other attendees at the Asset Project Office (APO) main conference room. After a meet and greet the CO of the APO and CTD Chief presented a short overview of the APO and CTD responsibilities.     PMS 326 provided the resources they have and how those resources have been employed to provide support for customer countries ranging from logistic support, help with planning ship repair availabilities and fly away teams that can assist/conduct repairs and in-country training. They described that the assets used could be active duty USN personnel, NAVSESS Technical Assist personnel or civilian contractors. It was brought out that the prime contractor they use for technical assists and training was VSE.     PMS 326 stated they have several ways to support USCG transfers for planning work prior to an actual case being implemented and could also fund certain types of advance repair work, which would be refunded from the USCG FMS case funds once they were implemented.    The CTD asked if they could store excess 110 and 378 cutter equipment and material that was being removed from USCG stocks at the warehouses controlled by 326 and Ken Miller stated yes they could.    The subject of the inability of the USCG Contracting Officers to push through contracts in a timely manner was discussed as a possible cause for delay with providing services for upcoming 110 transfers.  There was discussion on how that that process could be sped up to support transfer schedules. CG-922 concurred that it could be a problem but had no idea how to fix it. Todd Rienert asked NAVSEA how long it took them to get a contract in place and Paul Stephens stated usually 15 days. (That is pretty optimistic).    CTD brought out that the plan was to use the USCG Curtis Bay Yard to conduct the transfer repair work on a catch as can basis for the 110 Cutters.  It was discussed using them would make it very hard to stay on the transfer schedule and could possibly cause delays.     Paul Stephens asked for the name of the private shipyard so he could pass to VSE and possibly have VSE add them to their list of subs.     Paul stated that VSE has shipyards in other locations with much lower labor rates that they have used in the past to support ship transfers. LCDR Fleming (CG-922) jumped in and stated that VSE was too expensive due to high overhead costs. Paul countered that since the USCG Yard labor rate was $65-85/hr that using VSE to possibly contract with other yards with much lower labor rates would offset VSEs overhead costs and allow the USCG to meet transfer milestones on time.    Possible VSE involvement in upcoming USCG 110 and larger ship transfers could include contracting with shipyards to conduct post transfer availabilities and possibly augmenting USCG trainers with contractors and providing contractor support for in-country repairs and logistic support. VSE could possibly be used to contract for the overhaul of the MPDEs and Generators that will be pulled off of the two 110s that were transferred to the Marine Corps in Cherry Point, NC.    Paul Stephens and Rich Mitchell both seem very pro-VSE and CG-922 seems very anti VSE.

The ship was in week four of the second phase of training and the Ships Force (SF) was still in the crawling stage. If the ship has a major fire now or during the transit it is the opinion of the CTD team that the BN cannot effectively handle it alone.   In observing drills the USCG instructors did not have lesson plans, in preparation for the drills or after the completion of the drills there were no drill brief sheets.  The BN was not familiar with the assigned positions on the fire party, Zebra was not set properly and no follow up training was conducted.  Space watch standers were not familiar with immediate actions to be taken.    The USCG training team was not familiar with their responsibility to prevent BN personnel from operating equipment in an unsafe manner and not IAW Engineering Operating Procedures (EOP).  The training team was not aware of their end goal when training has been completed.  They need to understand that their training is part of the safe to sail criteria as described in USCG instructions.    The material condition of the ship is  in very bad condition and the USCG had not develop a work package to repair equipment and machinery to ensure that the ship meets the minimum equipment req1uirements for SAFE TO SAIL IAW USCG instructions.  USCG code 922 uses the term “AS IS WHERE IS” to defer repairs to vital equipment to make the ship safe-to-sail.   The Training Plan being used was developed by asking the BN, what would you like to be trained on? USCG should develop a plan and recommend to foreign crew this is what we would train a USCG crew on to operate this cutter.     There is no permanent waterfront manager assigned to the ship.  The USCG assigns a person to support the ship for a couple of weeks and then is relieved, frequently with no face to face turnover thus limiting support for the BN crew.  The USCG training team departed the ship on 19 June and the ship will not depart until the fall of 2015.      The USCG appears to have no concept of what level they should train to and what their liability is as far as safe to sail training.  The training and material condition of the cutter is a recipe for serious casualties and possibly loss of life when the BN steams the ship home.    Larry and the CTD team are developing a white paper with suggestions on improved training, use of a permanent waterfront manager and developing a minimal repair package so the ship would at a minimum meet USCG safe to sail criteria.  Larry has learned that the USCG instruction for transfers lays out most of these criteria for ship transfers.  Larry is also inserting that VSE contractor personnel could support all of these initiatives.

Representatives Fisher and Kindler explained that they had been exploring this possibility with UpTime Parts and Morgan Olson but had hit a snag tied to what they believed was the wiring harness and ECUs ability to communicate with the gasoline engine and transmission.  WBI thought we might have a potential solution with PSI on their 8.8L engine coupled with a new Allison Transmission.  That however is only a small part of the story.  The bigger challenge is EPA certification per Horace Mast who WBIs go-to engineer with respect to powertrain applications.  With Masts input, we explained that specific challenges exist to re-badging the platform when going from diesel to gas and those could require meeting the latest EPA emissions requirement and issuing a new VIN number.  The other part of the challenge involves platform specific calibration that would need to be done in the field.  Total cost estimates could push the effort to close to $40,000 per unit which makes it questionable.  NEW vehicles with the latest technology could be had for similar cost based on a purchase of 50 new trucks.  WBI gave Aramark the complete story and told them that it was not as simple as a new ECU and Wiring Harness.  We went on to explain that EPA re-certification was probably something not easily side-stepped if they were to conduct the effort the correct way.  The only other option available to them was to consider a diesel to propane option -  which PSI could offer them.  We left the conference call with the understanding that Aramark may explore Green Funding to support the effort of a conversion to propane instead of gasoline.  This effort, should it proceed forward at all, will require a considerable amount of time to determine viability.  At best, it would be a 2016 effort.

Under the current executive leadership at Combat Propulsion Systems, the business strategy has been to shrink the factory space to improve manufacturing efficiency.  Theory is that less movement of material can reduce manufacturing time and result in lower cost products. ... ... ... In practice, the company has dismantled a significant section of the 1 million square foot production area with the idea that L-3 can lease that manufacturing space to another 1 to 3 companies.  In their minds, they cannot see any L-3 use for the factory at its present size and space, and they believe the only option to make money in the factory is to lease the space to another company. ... ... ... That was the strategy in 2013 and 2014. ... ... ... At this point, there is a rumor that since they cannot find anyone to lease factory space, their 2015 business strategy is now to actually sell the building and then lease back the smaller work space needed for CPS to manufacture their engines and transmissions. ... ... ... While that plan can only lead to unseen events and possible catastrophe, it might play into the strategic plans for VSE.  I believe someone told me last year that VSE made an offer to buy CPS with their objective to put a significant volume of business into the factory.  L-3 apparently never replied to VSEs offer, but that was likely due to L-3s strategy to only lease the factory to another company. ... ... ...  Now that L-3 is considering to sell the factory, VSE might want to re-think their business plans. ... ... ... ... For example; when the tank program is awarded and production starts, VSE could realize a significant benefit from already owning the CPS factory space where the engines, powerpacks, suspensions, and many other products could be produced and assembled. It might then become a stepping off point for VSE to acquire CPS and thereby own the engine, powerpack, suspension, and many other products that go into the tank upgrade solution. ... ... ... ... this could marry well with the longer term M60A4S business strategy. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

They we need to modify this DO 0159 (follow on DO) and increase it by about $500K with 30% labor and 70% material.  Kemal and Larry H. agreed we could submit both the DO 0117 deobligation and the Mod to DO 0159 simultaneous so they will be worked in tandem to minimize time.  A majority of the $500K will be expended this year.

This will cover the completion of the installation support and training.  Kemal and Larry H. concurred with this action.  Larry H. asked that the DO be extended to 31 Dec 2015 to ensure we do not have to extend the DO again if schedules do not work out for the training.  Do 0170 – Turkey Broadband Acoustic Tracking System (BATS) Equip Procurement and Modification (total value $65K)    A modification to this DO is required to extend the PoP and add some additional funding for administrative purposes that accrue as a result of the PoP extension.

Larry H stated that he would be contacting the IWS-3 representative (Nicky) to see if any inputs have been received from Lockheed Martin for their part of the list. This should result in a $3M (primarily AB material) modification to existing DO 0159.  Kemal and Larry H. concurred with this action.    CIWS Upgrade (future work) – GLOBAL discussed the status of the task with Kemal and Larry H. They indicated that the budgetary numbers Larry S provided on 24 May 2015 have been rolled into their preliminary response to the LOR.  The draft D.O. that GLOBAL prepared needs to be modified to remove certain sections (procurement of installation materials etc.) since that will be handled by another party.

Conversion of IETM from MIL-STD-40051 change 3 to MIL-STD-40051-1B and 2B, and 13&P to 23&P.   b. Identify all Work Packages (WPs) related to Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) including maintenance tracks within the PMCS.   c. Identify all troubleshooting WPs related to maintenance tasks identified within PMCS.   d. Update XML dataset for the IETM to incorporate redline changes from Oshkosh validation of tasks identified in items 1 and 3.   e. Review 365 ECPs to develop master list of IETM WPs that will require update for the IETM.   f. If there is room within the funded ceiling the Scope of Work (SOW) would be expanded to include additional work updating WPs of Oshkosh identified systems, i.e. Engine, Suspension, Transmission etc.   A separated Request For Quote (RFQ) would be issued for the expanded scope.

There have been several revisions to the scope since this initial contact with Oshkosh.  The first update on 4/9/2015 removed the ILS review of ECPs from the scope.

Instead of breaking the effort into phases, the US Government decided to update the entire data set in 30 months starting October 2015. This gives Oshkosh and their sub 22-24 months of development time. Oshkosh is expecting the RFP to be released sometime in September with further details.

WBI requested samples of the product and pricing to present to Republic Services now that WBI is live on their Ariba e-Pro system.  A subsequent discussion with Lonnie Sullivan revealed that Republic was using Cummins on the PMs and while they had a Champion Plug alternative, their own VMFs were reluctant to use the Champion product - to avoid push-back on warranty issues on these new trucks.  I explained to Lonnie that we now had a direct OE alternative in Denso with them being OE to Cummins.  That removed the warranty anxiety from the equation.  We did some research on-line and determined our best guess at where Republic might be price-wise with Cummins and quoted a comfortable margin by kitting the plugs with a protective rubber boot and dielectric grease.  Our quote was attractive and Lonnie immediately gave us authorization to proceed with loading the product up on Ariba.  That effort has been made and we are now awaiting formal confirmation from Republic that the offering is live on the network.  Attached is a flyer page created internally by WBI to be used in Republics nationwide announcement to their facilities and to be distributed by WBI at Waste Expo the first week in June.

The current COs are not happy about this change since it could mean that their jobs will move from Emmitsburg, MD to Washington DC.      One point of concern for our approach to pursue this opportunity is the recent trend of contracting officers using GSA schedules and 8(a) procurements moving towards those mechanisms.  As such, we asked Bryan if this opportunity was going to be structured to allow 8(a) JVs to compete for this work.  Bryan confirmed that as of now, the procurement is planned to be a competitive 8(a) award which would allow SBA-certified 8(a) JVs to pursue the AFG opportunity.

The primary takeaways from the meeting:    The funding line for removal, repair and reinstallation of the Marine Gas Turbine Gas Generator is $1.9M.  This will be used to fund labor, material and travel for Wood Group Pratt & Whitney (WGPW) to provide one service representative for the removal of the GG4A gas generator, shipment of the gas generator to the WGPW repair facility, Open and Inspect, follow-on repairs, engine testing, re-shipment of the engine to Alameda, CA and re-installation. The repair time line is estimated to be from 90-120 days (dependent on results of the Open and Inspect).    The funding line for the repair of one of the Main Propulsion Diesel Engines (MPDE) has been reduced from $1.3M to $360K.  The USCG has withheld funding for Center Section Overhaul (CSO) kit which is about $600K.  There will be sufficient funding to cover the labor/travel quote from Fairbanks Morse Engine for one service representative and the cost for one VSE subject matter expert (Guy Chrzas) during the 42-day overhaul period, however there will be scarce funding to cover growth work or to fund outside machinists/riggers (if not provided by Bangladesh Navy) to assist in the overhaul.    The funding line for the Supply Support has been reduced from $2M to $1.1M.  This will allow procurement of most of the parts that were priced by VSE in October 2014.  Paul has requested that the parts should be shipped to USCG Logistics Center in Alameda to inventory/warehouse since they reduced the funding rather than being consolidated in VSE-Chesapeake.  This plan could change if USCG pushes back.    The funding line for Emergent Technical Support labor has been reduced to $115K from $300K.  This amount may be needed to fund outside machinists/riggers if they are not available from the Bangladesh Navy.

Paul was thinking if he could have Thomas Gearhart that would be sufficient support from VSE.  His transfer manager will be Joe Garcia (great guy but not a clue on ship transfers).  I reminded Paul that he had called me right before Christmas and had ask me who was going to manage the ship transfers and I had told him I would.  He acknowledged that conversation but said he had forgotten.  I also reminded him that he wanted to get together and discuss, which had not happened with his travel and vacation time since Christmas.  However, we had provided Steve Keith information on shipyard costs – West vice East Coast) and we briefed him on our plan for keeping the FFGs warm after decommissioning.  We also briefed him on the process we use in developing a Preliminary SARP with ROM pricing, Preliminary Work Definition Conference, ordering long lead material, writing specifications, selecting a ship yard, conducting a Work Definition Conference finishing buying material and starting the shipyard overhaul.  Based on Paul’s comment none of this information had made it to Paul.    Paul was talking about doing one ship on the West Coast and one on the East coast because of the cost of towing the ship from the West Coast to the East Coast.  I mentioned to him that the labor difference between the West and East was about $20 an hour so then he said well maybe it would be better to do both ships on the East Coast.  He was also saying he thought doing the shipyard overhauls in Jacksonville made a lot of sense.  His reasoning is they have a berthing barge that can be towed across the river from Mayport, that Southeast Regional Maintenance Center, (SERMC) would be a big advantage since they have expertise.  He was also thinking SERMC could do some work if the shipyard was behind schedule and the Port Engineers for the FFGs is home based out of Mayport.  I provided him advertised pricing between Detyens and BAE Jax, with Detyens being about $15.50 per hour cheaper.  Told him that does not mean that these are the prices the shipyard will bid anticipate they will both come down depending on their work load.  Paul is aware that Taiwan is very interested in going back to Detyens but he has told them that the messing and berthing that was available during the Kidds is not available.  He is pushing Taiwan to go for open competition and I told him on the East Coast we expected BAE Jax, Detyens and Colonnas to be the bidders if we put the package out to bid.   We also talked a little about keeping ships warm after being decommissioned but he didn’t think there was a lot of support for this.  He did say they were looking at ways to keep from towing the San Diego ship to Hawaii to INACTSHIPS.  I told him based on having some Taiwan personnel available and some of our key personnel that for about $1M (USN providing pier and services) we could keep the ship warm for about 3 months.    He indicate that Taiwan is considering sending a detachment of personnel to the US to be home based out of TECRO Washington to go visit the inactive ships once a month to make sure equipment and material was not being removed.  Paul hopes this happens because this is confirmation that Taiwan will take the ships.   I told Paul I would be happy to have Thomas work with us but that I was looking a Bill Reynolds to help me with a lot of the planning.  He said he did not know Bill.  (Pete Desrosiers a couple of days later called Paul to get a read from him and he is OK with me doing the Transfer and using Bill and he said yes and remembers his phone call to me in late December.  He would like for Thomas to be part of the team.)   Since our meeting we have provided Paul with ROM towing costs up and down the East Coast and from West Coast to East Coast.  We also provided him with shipyard hourly costs and approximate total cost for shipyard labor based on the Pakistan overhaul of McInerney for BAE San Diego, Norfolk, Jax and Detyens.
